# Deahl Farms Repo

This site is a tool built for stakeholders of Deahl Farms to visualize the farm surfae to examine how to best implement erosion mitigation strategies. There is also an ongoing climate anlysis tool that lets viewers examine past weather patterns. As more crop yeild data becomes available in the future, I will make tools to help find insights in correlations between weather and irrigation patterns and crop metrics. 

The site can be accessed [here](https://texascovidtracking.herokuapp.com/).
